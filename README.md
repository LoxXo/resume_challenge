# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

## Too long; didn't read
The final result of my approach to the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is this very repository and my website: https://jwajda.com.
* HTML and CSS for website hosted in Azure Static Web Apps
* API in Python as Azure Functions
* NoSQL CosmosDB database to hold the data
* Javascript to request the API and display the response on the webpage
* Smoke testing with Cypress to check if webpage content loads and API is accesible
* Deployment is written in Bicep
* CI/CD is done in GitHub Actions

## Reflections on the project
To be done...
